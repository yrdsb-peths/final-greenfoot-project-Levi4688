**The Dolphin Game**

Description of the game:
In this immersive aquatic adventure, players will transform into dolphins and swim in a vibrant aquatic world. Your mission is clear: eat as many jellyfish as possible to maintain the balance of the aquarium's fragile ecosystem. But be aware that potential hazards may shorten your trip. With every jellyfish you eat, your score will go up, but with every meal you miss, you will die. How long can you quell your hunger and prove yourself as the ultimate apex predator of the deep? Dive in and have fun in this heart-pounding pursuit of survival!
